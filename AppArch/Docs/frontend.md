# Pages for text edits

For anyone modifying text with no experience using JSX, please look for the return statement in the frontend/BMFT/src/components folder. It will usually be followed by a <div> tag.

## Where to make edits:

### BIOPages

    - Board.js
    - Ourteam.js
    - Staff.js
    - Supporters.js
